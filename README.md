# ECOTREX

ECOTREX is a research project aimed at imputing ecological diet traits for extinct bird species using information from extant taxa and phylogenetic context.

## Project objective
The main goal of ECOTREX is to reconstruct diet composition of extinct bird species by integrating:
- quantitative diet data from extant species,
- morphological and ecological predictors,
- taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships between extant and extinct taxa.

The resulting framework allows estimating diet traits for extinct species while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.

## Repository structure
- `data/`: datasets used in the project (raw, processed and predicted datasets; see subfolder README files)
- `scripts/`: analysis pipelines and reproducible workflows
- `outputs/`: figures and tables generated by the analyses
- `docs/`: methodological notes and supplementary documentation

## Data
- Raw datasets include global trait databases for extant and extinct birds (e.g. AVONET, AVOTREX) and taxonomic bridges linking both groups.  
- Processed datasets include XXXX
- Predicted datasets include imputed diet composition for extinct bird species, together with associated uncertainty estimates.

## Reproducibility
All analyses are implemented in Phyton.  
Scripts are designed to be run sequentially.
